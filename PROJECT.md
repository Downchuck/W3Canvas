This project is an experimental web browser engine written in JavaScript. It uses the HTML5 Canvas element to render HTML and CSS. It appears to be a simulation of a browser environment, including a DOM, CSS parsing, and rendering.

The project is located at: https://github.com/ASDAlexander77/TypeScriptCompiler

The goal is to get this project ready to run a full DOM and work with the TypeScript compiler. This involves understanding the existing codebase, which is written in JavaScript, and then migrating it or integrating it with TypeScript.

A previous attempt was made to use Bresenham's line drawing algorithm, and this should be kept in mind.
