# HTML Implementation Analysis

This document analyzes the current state of the HTML implementation in this project, identifies missing HTML5 features, and provides recommendations for future development.

## Current State of HTML Implementation

The HTML implementation is based on a custom DOM and parser.

*   **DOM:** The DOM is defined in `src/dom/html/dom_core.js` and `src/dom/html/dom_html_basic.js`. It includes a generic `Element` class and a more specific `HTMLElement` class that adds common attributes.
*   **Parser:** The parser in `src/dom/parser/html_parser.js` builds a DOM tree from an HTML string. However, it does not use the `document.createElement` mechanism and instead creates generic `Element` objects for all tags.
*   **Element Registration:** A `registerElement` function in `src/dom/html/dom_html_basic.js` maps tag names to specific element constructor functions. This allows for specialized implementations of certain elements.

## Supported HTML Elements

The following HTML elements have specific implementations:

*   `<form>`
*   `<body>`
*   `<span>`
*   `<div>`
*   `<p>`
*   `<input>` (generic, without support for most modern types)
*   `<textarea>`
*   `<img>`
*   `<button>`
*   `<a>` (as `HTMLLinkElement`)
*   `<canvas>` (the core focus of the project)

## Missing HTML5 Features

The implementation is missing a significant number of HTML5 features.

### Semantic Elements
The following structural and semantic elements are not supported:
*   `<article>`
*   `<section>`
*   `<nav>`
*   `<aside>`
*   `<header>`
*   `<footer>`
*   `<main>`
*   `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`

### Multimedia
*   `<audio>`
*   `<video>`

### Form Controls
The `<input>` element lacks support for the new types introduced in HTML5, such as:
*   `date`, `time`, `datetime-local`
*   `number`, `range`
*   `color`
*   `email`, `url`, `search`, `tel`

### Other Elements
*   `<details>` and `<summary>`
*   `<progress>` and `<meter>`
*h*   `<time>`
*   `<mark>`

### APIs
Many important HTML5 JavaScript APIs are not implemented, including:
*   Web Storage (localStorage, sessionStorage)
*   Web Workers
*   WebSockets
*   Geolocation API
*   Drag and Drop API
*   History API

## Recommendations

To improve HTML5 compliance, I recommend the following:

1.  **Enhance the Parser:**
    *   Modify the parser to use `document.createElement` to ensure that the correct element classes are instantiated for each tag.
2.  **Implement Semantic Elements:**
    *   Create classes for the main semantic elements (`<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, etc.). For many of these, simply inheriting from `HTMLElement` and ensuring they are block-level elements would be a good start.
3.  **Expand Form Controls:**
    *   Add support for the new `<input>` types. This will require creating specialized rendering and interaction logic for each type.
4.  **Implement Multimedia Elements:**
    *   Create classes for the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, including the necessary APIs for controlling playback.
5.  **Tackle HTML5 APIs:**
    *   Gradually implement the most important HTML5 APIs, such as Web Storage and Web Workers, to create a more feature-rich environment.
