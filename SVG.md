# SVG Implementation Analysis

This document analyzes the current state of the SVG implementation in this project, identifies missing features, and provides recommendations for future development.

## Overall Architecture

The SVG rendering engine is built on top of a custom DOM and HTML parser. The general architecture is as follows:

1.  **DOM:** A basic DOM is implemented in `src/dom/html/dom_core.js`, with `Node`, `Element`, `TextNode`, and `Document` classes. An `HTMLDocument` class in `src/dom/html/dom_html_doc.js` extends the base `Document` and provides HTML-specific features.
2.  **HTML Parser:** An HTML parser in `src/dom/parser/html_parser.js` tokenizes and parses HTML into a DOM tree.
3.  **SVG Elements:** SVG elements are implemented as classes that inherit from a base `SVGElement` class. Each element class (e.g., `Rectangle`, `Circle`) is responsible for its own rendering.
4.  **Rendering:** The rendering is done on an HTML `<canvas>` element. Each SVG element has a `repaint` method that gets a 2D rendering context from a parent `<canvas>` element and draws itself on the canvas.

## Missing DOM and Parsing Features

The DOM and parsing implementation is incomplete, which significantly impacts the SVG functionality.

*   **`window` Object:** There is no `window` object. A proper `window` object is essential for providing a standard environment for the DOM and other APIs, such as `window.document` and `window.document.fonts`.
*   **SVG Namespace Handling:** The HTML parser does not handle XML namespaces. As a result, it cannot distinguish between HTML and SVG elements. It creates generic `Element` objects for all tags, instead of specialized `SVGElement` objects.
*   **`createElementNS`:** The `document` object does not have a `createElementNS` method, which is the standard way to create namespaced elements like SVG.
*   **DOM Traversal:** The mechanism for finding the canvas context by traversing up the DOM tree is non-standard and brittle.

## Missing SVG Features

The SVG implementation itself is missing many core features.

*   **Container Elements:** There is no implementation for container elements like `<svg>` and `<g>`. These are fundamental for grouping and transforming SVG content.
*   **Transformations:** The `transform` attribute (e.g., `translate`, `scale`, `rotate`) is not supported.
*   **Styling:** While there is a `currentColor` implementation, there is no general mechanism for applying CSS styles to SVG elements.
*   **Path Element:** The `<path>` element, one of the most powerful SVG features, is not fully implemented. A `path_parser.js` exists, but its integration and rendering capabilities are unclear.
*   **Text Element:** An `svg_text.js` file exists, but the full extent of its implementation is unknown. SVG text has many complex features, such as `tspan`, text on a path, and various text-related attributes.
*   **Other Shapes:** Many other basic shapes are not implemented, such as `<polygon>` and `<polyline>`.
*   **Gradients and Patterns:** While the canvas context supports gradients, there is no implementation for SVG's `<linearGradient>`, `<radialGradient>`, or `<pattern>` elements.

## Missing Font Handling Features

The font handling implementation is also incomplete.

*   **Font Loading:** The `font_loader.js` can only load fonts from `file:///` URLs. It cannot fetch fonts from the network.
*   **`@font-face` support:** The parsing of `@font-face` rules is minimal and does not support all descriptors.

## Recommendations

To bring the SVG implementation to a more complete state, I recommend the following steps:

1.  **Implement a `window` object:** Create a `window` object that serves as the global context and owns the `document` object.
2.  **Improve the parser:**
    *   Add namespace support to the parser to correctly handle SVG and other XML-based languages.
    *   Use `document.createElementNS` to create elements with the correct namespace.
3.  **Implement core SVG features:**
    *   Implement the `<svg>` and `<g>` container elements.
    *   Add support for the `transform` attribute.
    *   Develop a robust system for applying CSS styles to SVG elements.
    *   Complete the implementation of the `<path>` and `<text>` elements.
4.  **Enhance the font loading:**
    *   Implement font loading from network URLs.
    *   Improve the `@font-face` parsing to support more descriptors.
5.  **Refactor the rendering process:**
    *   Instead of having each element render itself, implement a centralized rendering engine that traverses the DOM and draws the elements. This will make it easier to handle transformations and other global effects.
