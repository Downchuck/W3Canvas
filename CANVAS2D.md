# Canvas 2D Implementation Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the current Canvas 2D implementation, highlighting missing features and providing recommendations for future development.

## Missing `CanvasRenderingContext2D` Features

The following properties and methods are missing from the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` implementation, based on the MDN documentation.

### Transformations
- `rotate()`
- `scale()` (stubbed)
- `translate()` (stubbed)
- `transform()`
- `setTransform()`
- `resetTransform()`
- `getTransform()`
- **Note:** There are `TODO` comments for these in `src/core/canvas/CanvasRenderingContext2D.js`.

### Gradients and Patterns
- `createRadialGradient()`
- `createConicGradient()`
- `createConicGradient()`

#### `createPattern()`
Seems to be implemented. Used in:
- `src/dom/html/combobox_control.js`
- `examples/text_path.html`
- Legacy code: `examples/Z_testing_select_old/combo_blue.js`, `src/legacy/style/combo_blue.js`

### Shadows
- `shadowBlur`
- `shadowColor`
- `shadowOffsetX`
- `shadowOffsetY`
- **Note:** There is some commented-out code related to shadows in `src/dom/css/box_paint.js`.

### Paths
- `roundRect()`
  - **Note:** There are existing `round_rectangle` implementations in `src/dom/css/box_paint.js` and `examples/Z_testing_select_old/all.select.yui.js` that are not exposed on the `CanvasRenderingContext2D`.
- `arcTo()`
- `quadraticCurveTo()`
  - **Note:** Used in the `round_rectangle` implementations mentioned above.

### Path Drawing
- `isPointInStroke()`
- `drawFocusIfNeeded()`

### Line Styles
- **Note:** `getLineDash`, `setLineDash`, and `lineDashOffset` are implemented. The `miterLimit` logic has been corrected and is now functional.

### Text Styles
- `direction`
- `fontKerning`
- `fontStretch`
- `fontVariantCaps`
- `letterSpacing`
- `wordSpacing`
- `textRendering`

### Image Smoothing
- `imageSmoothingEnabled`
- `imageSmoothingQuality`

### Compositing
- `globalCompositeOperation`

### Other
- `getContextAttributes()`
- `isContextLost()`
- `reset()`
- `filter`

## Missing Supporting API Features

The following supporting APIs and features are either missing or incomplete.

### FontFace API
- **URL Loading:** The `FontFace.load()` method does not currently fetch fonts from URLs.
- **`@font-face` Parsing:** There is no integration with the CSS parser to automatically create `FontFace` objects from `@font-face` rules.
- **`FontFaceSet` Events:** The `onloading`, `onloadingdone`, and `onloadingerror` event handlers are missing.
- **`FontFaceSet.ready` Promise:** The `ready` promise is not implemented.
- **Extended Descriptors:** Support for `unicodeRange`, `featureSettings`, and `variationSettings` is missing.

### Path2D API
The `Path2D` object is not implemented. This includes the `Path2D` constructor and methods that accept a `Path2D` object, such as:
- `fill(path)`
- `stroke(path)`
- `clip(path)`

### OffscreenCanvas
The `OffscreenCanvas` API is not implemented. This would allow for canvas rendering in Web Workers.

### Web Workers
There is no support for using the Canvas API within Web Workers (e.g., via `OffscreenCanvas` and `self.fonts`).

## High-Level Recommendations

Based on this analysis, we recommend the following priorities for future development:

1.  **Implement `roundRect()`:** This is a new and frequently requested feature.
2.  **Complete the Transformations API:** Implementing `translate()`, `scale()`, `rotate()`, and the other transform methods is crucial for basic canvas functionality.
3.  **Expand Gradient and Pattern Support:** Adding support for radial and conic gradients, as well as patterns, will significantly improve the rendering capabilities.
4.  **Implement the `Path2D` API:** This will allow for more complex and reusable path objects.
5.  **Investigate `OffscreenCanvas` and Web Worker Support:** To improve performance and enable multi-threading, support for `OffscreenCanvas` should be a long-term goal.
