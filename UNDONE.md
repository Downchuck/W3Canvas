The next step is to integrate a font rendering library. The Cufon library was identified as a good candidate from the era. The following steps are needed:
1. Obtain the Cufon library files (`cufon-yui.js`).
2. Obtain a font file converted by the Cufon generator.
3. Integrate the library into the project to replace the old font rendering system.
