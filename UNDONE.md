# Work in Progress

*   **Implement CSS Box Model and SVG DOM:** Continue filling out the implementation of the CSS box model and the SVG implementation.
*   **Font Rendering:** The font rendering system has been updated to use a JavaScript port of `stb_truetype`, allowing the use of TTF fonts. The system currently loads a single hardcoded font (`DejaVuSans.ttf`). Future work could involve implementing the `@font-face` rule to allow loading of custom fonts.
