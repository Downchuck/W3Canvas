# Remaining Work for ES Modules Refactoring

This document outlines the remaining work required to complete the refactoring of the codebase to use ES Modules.

## Completed Work

- The project has been set up to use ES Modules (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`).
- The general namespace has been changed from `colorjack` to `w3canvas`.
- The following directories and files have been refactored to use ES Modules:
  - `alg/`
  - `font/`
  - Most of `css/`
  - Most of `html/`

## Remaining Refactoring

The following files and directories still need to be refactored to use ES Modules:

- `canvas_lib.js`
- `css/` (remaining files)
- `html/` (remaining files)
  - `html/button_control.js`
  - `html/combobox_control.js`
  - `html/control_factory.js`
  - `html/slider_control.js`
  - `html/textbox/` directory
- `jsb/behaviors.js`
- `style/` directory
- `tb_test/` directory

## Remaining Plan Steps

The following steps from the original plan still need to be completed:

1.  **Finish refactoring the codebase to use ES Modules.**
2.  **Update the build process and test.**
    - Remove the `build` script from `package.json`.
    - Update the HTML files in the `examples` directory to load the new ES modules.
    - Test the changes by opening one of the examples in the browser.
3.  **Final cleanup.**
    - Remove any old files that are no longer needed, such as `tsconfig.json`, `types/w3canvas.d.ts`, and the `dist` directory.
    - Review the code to ensure it's clean and consistent.
